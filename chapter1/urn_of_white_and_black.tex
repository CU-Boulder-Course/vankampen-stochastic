\leveldown{Urn of white and black - pg. 3}

\leveldown{Problem}

An urn contains a mixture of $N_1$ white balls and $N_2$ black ones.
I extract at random $M$ balls, without putting them back.
Show that the probability for having $n$ white balls among them is
\begin{equation*}
P(n) = \binom{N_1}{n} \binom{N_2}{M-n} / \binom{N_1 + N_2}{M} \, . \qquad \text{(``hypergeometric distribution'')}
\end{equation*}
This reduces to the volumes equation in the limit $N_1, N_2 \rightarrow \infty$ with $N_1/N_2 = \gamma$.
